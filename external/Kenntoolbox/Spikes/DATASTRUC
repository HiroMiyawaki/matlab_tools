METADATA MATLAB STRUCTURE INFO
------------------------------

DataBase: 
	struct array of Files

File: 
	Directory		string 			eg '/u14/hajime/SRS/l12-A'
	FileBase 		string			eg 'srs'
	Par				structure		as provided by LoadPar
	Epochs			structure array of Epoch
	ElecGps			structure array of ElecGp
	nCells			number			number of cells (not counting noise cluster)
	Cells			structure array of Cell
	CellMap 		nx2 array		gives ElecGp and cluster number for each cell (not counting noise cluster)
	Name			string			eg j2102
	
Epcoch:
	Type			string			Type of epoch (e.g. 'Theta');
	Start			number			time in seconds since beginning of file
	End				number			time in seconds since beginning of file
	
	NB epochs of a given type must be non-overlapping and in chronological order.
	
ElecGp: (i.e. tetrode)
	Par1			structure		as provided by LoadPar1
	Location		string			eg '1, 3, h' (see README for .des file description)
	nCells			number			number of cells on this tetrode (not counting noise cluster)
	FirstCell		number			number of first cell of this tetrode in overall .clu file
	
Cell:
	Type			string			e.g. 'p' for pyramidal (see REAME for description of .des file)
	SubType			string			2nd column of .des file
	eDist			number			Cluster quality as measured by equal distance
	bRat			number			Cluster quality as measured by burst ratio
