METADATA RELATIONAL DATABASE TABLE INFO
---------------------------------------

Metadata phase 2 moves over to a relational database ... this should make
things easier in the long run ...

Here's a description of the tables:

Files - contains one entry per .dat file
-----
INT FileID; primary key
VARCHAR FileBase; FileBase - e.g. '/u15/xaj/Awake/l23-01/f3'
INT nCh; number of channels in the whole file (whether or not they are used)
INT nBits; usually 12 or 16
INT SampleRate; Sample rate in Hz
DOUBLE HiPassFreq; Frequency at which the file was digitally hi-pass filtered
VARCHAR Description; description of the type of experiment (eg 'Awake', 'SRS', etc)

ElecGps - contains one entry per electrode group (eg tetrode)
-------
INT ElecGpID; primary key
INT FileID; which file did it come from?
VARCHAR Location; electrode location: '1' means CA1, etc.  Not often used yet
INT GpNo; tetrode number as found in the .par file
VARCHAR Unit; unit of measurement (e.g. mV, nA)
DOUBLE Gain; 1 sample = this many units
VARCHAR Type; e.g. 'Extracellular', 'Intracellular', 'Current'

Channels - tells you which channels belong in which tetrodes
--------
INT ChannelID; primary key
// INT FileID; which .dat file the channel belongs to
INT ChannelNo; number of the channel within the .dat file
INT ElecGpID; which tetrode the channel is assigned to

NB only channels that are assigned to an electrode group are put in here.  Database
afficionados will know that FileID should not be there, because it is available
from ElecGps

Cells
-----
INT CellID; primary key
INT ElecGpID; tetrode this cell was recorded from
VARCHAR Type; Cell type: 'p'=pyramidal, 'b'=interneuron
VARCHAR SubType; not often used
INT BigCluNo; cluster number in the .clu file
INT SmallCluNo; cluster number in the .clu.n file
DOUBLE eDist; isolation distance measure
DOUBLE bRat; burst ratio qualtiy measure
DOUBLE fRate; firing rate in Hz

for the future...

Epochs - says which time periods fall into which epoch descriptors
------
INT EpochID; primary key
VARCHAR Type; epoch type (eg 'NonTheta', 'Theta', 'Ripple', 'Run', 'Sleep1', 'Sleep2');
DOUBLE Start; start time in seconds
DOUBLE End; end time in seconds

CellEquivs - for identifying single cells across files
----------
EquivNo - identifies equivalence classes
CellID - Cell number

so if one cell was recorded in 3 files, as cell 34, cell 40, and cell 57, there would
be 3 entries in this table: (N,34), (N,40), and (N,57) where N is the equivalence number.
There is no primary key field; instead EquivNo and CellID form a joint primary key
